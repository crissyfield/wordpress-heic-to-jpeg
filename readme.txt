Convert HEIC images to JPEG format when upload to the Media Library.

== Description ==

Convert HEIC images to JPEG format when upload to the Media Library.

HEIC is the file format name Apple has chosen for the "High Efficiency Image Format" (HEIF) standard. HEIF
offers better compression than JPEG, so it takes up less storage space, while maintaining the same visual
quality. The format has been used by default since iOS 11, i.e. for images sent through the Messages app or
when exporting.

This plugin adds HEIC/HEIF support to Wordpress by transparently converting the uploaded image to JPEG.

Note: ImageMagick 7.0.8-46 or above is required to be installed on the server.

== Installation ==

1. Install **HEIC to JPEG** either via the WordPress.org plugin repository or by uploading the files to your
   server. (See instructions on [how to install a WordPress
   plugin](http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/)).
