# HEIC to JPEG Wordpress Plugin

Convert HEIC images to JPEG format when upload to the Media Library.

HEIC is the file format name Apple has chosen for the “High Efficiency Image Format” (HEIF) standard. HEIF offers better compression than JPEG, so it takes up less storage space, while maintaining the same visual quality. The format has been used by default since iOS 11, i.e. for images sent through the Messages app or when exporting.

This plugin adds HEIC/HEIF support to WordPress by transparently converting the uploaded image to JPEG.

Note: ImageMagick 7.0.8-46 or above is required to be installed on the server.
